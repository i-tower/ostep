## Virtual Memory

Every program has its own virtual address space


#### Goals

* **Transparency**  The fact that memory is virtualized should have no impact on a running program. As far as the program is aware it has some actual physical memory

* **Efficiency** Virtualization should us as few resources as possible.

* **Protection** The should ensure that processes are protected from eachother and the OS itself is protected from processes. Processes should be **isolated**
