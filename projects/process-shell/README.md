## A simple shell

In this project we will implement a simple shell. Meaning a terminal command prompt from which we can run other programs. The shell should operate in 2 modes.  Interactive and Batch.

The shell should be able to run programs found in the systems path. Eg. ls -la

The shell should exit when a user enters exit

The default path should contain "/bin"

The user should be able to cd to different directories


The user should be able to run commands in parallel 

```

wish> cmd1 & cmd2 args1 args2 & cmd3 args1

```
